EADME for Project 1: Blender Bridge Model
Project Overview

This project involves creating a simplified 3D model of a bridge using Blender. The model should include various types of objects and demonstrate different projection techniques, color assignments, and animation features.
Tasks

    Bridge Model:
        Create a 3D model of a bridge using Mesh and NURBS objects.
        Apply boolean operations between meshes.
        Provide screenshots of the model from Blender's 3D Viewport, showing various projections.

    Color Assignment:
        Assign distinct colors to different elements of the bridge.
        Provide RGB and HSV values for the colors used.
        Include a render image showing the application of these colors.

    Vehicle Models:
        Import up to 6 simplified vehicle models.
        Animate the vehicles to move across the bridge.
        Provide screenshots showing keyframing and interpolation.

    Camera Focus:
        Adjust the camera focus to capture vehicle movement.
        Experiment with front and back clipping planes.
        Provide screenshots illustrating different clipping plane values.

    Camera Animation:
        Animate the camera along a path to simulate a drone flying over the bridge.
        Provide a screenshot showing the camera path and type of geometric element used.
