README for Project 1: Blender Bridge Model
Project Overview

This project involves creating a simplified 3D model of a bridge using Blender. The model should include various types of objects and demonstrate different projection techniques, color assignments, and animation features.
Tasks

    Bridge Model:
        Create a 3D model of a bridge using Mesh and NURBS objects.
        Apply boolean operations between meshes.
        Provide screenshots of the model from Blender's 3D Viewport, showing various projections.

    Color Assignment:
        Assign distinct colors to different elements of the bridge.
        Provide RGB and HSV values for the colors used.
        Include a render image showing the application of these colors.

    Vehicle Models:
        Import up to 6 simplified vehicle models.
        Animate the vehicles to move across the bridge.
        Provide screenshots showing keyframing and interpolation.

    Camera Focus:
        Adjust the camera focus to capture vehicle movement.
        Experiment with front and back clipping planes.
        Provide screenshots illustrating different clipping plane values.

    Camera Animation:
        Animate the camera along a path to simulate a drone flying over the bridge.
        Provide a screenshot showing the camera path and type of geometric element used.

README for Project 2: WebGL Solar System Simulation
Project Overview

This project is a 3D simulation of a solar system using WebGL. The simulation features a star (the Sun), at least four planets, and a moon orbiting one of the planets. It includes interactions, textures, and various lighting effects.
Files

    SistemaSolar_CG09.mp4: Video showcasing the full solar system simulation.
    Sistema_Solar_CG09.html: HTML file to render the WebGL simulation.
    main_CG09.js: JavaScript file containing the WebGL code and simulation logic.
    style_CG09.css: CSS file for styling the HTML page.
    twgl.js-master.zip: Archive containing the TWGL library for simplified WebGL operations.

How to Use

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>

Set Up the Project:

    Unzip the twgl.js-master.zip file into the project directory. Ensure the TWGL library is in the correct location or update the path in main_CG09.js if necessary.

Open the Simulation:

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

        cd <project-directory>

        Open Sistema_Solar_CG09.html in a web browser to view the solar system simulation.

    Interact with the Scene:
        Camera Controls:
            Press 1 to reset the camera to Earth's position.
            Press 2 to reset the camera to the Sun's position.
            Press o to toggle the visibility of planet orbits.
            Use the arrow keys and mouse to move and rotate the camera.

    View and Analyze:
        Observe the 3D solar system simulation, including the movement of planets and the moon.
        Watch the video SistemaSolar_CG09.mp4 for a demonstration of the simulation and its features.

Features

    Camera Controls: Customizable views and camera movements.
    Shading Models: Gouraud and Phong shading applied to celestial objects.
    Animations: Planet and moon orbits with varied speeds and at least one elliptical orbit.
    Texturing: Textures applied to enhance realism.
